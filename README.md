**HANDWRITTEN DIGIT RECOGNITION SYSTEM**

Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of a computer to recognize the human handwritten digits from different sources like images, papers, touch screens, etc, and classify them into 10 predefined classes (0-9). This has been a topic of boundless-research in the field of deep learning.

The Recognition of Handwritten Digit can be done by several classification methods using Machine Learning, which have been developed and used for this purpose, such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest Classifier, etc., but these methods, whilst having the accuracy of 92%, are not adequate for real-world purposes.

In terms of accuracy score, we have implemented CNN algorithm to achieve 99% accuracy rate.
